# SQLiteClassBuilder
A command line tool for creating type safe SQL classes. The tool uses the database schema to create a class for each table and view. It has many command line options to allow developers to customize the class creation.
Each class is created in it's own header (*.h).  A master header is created which includes all the headers.
